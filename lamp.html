        <h2>the scoop lamp</h2>
        <p>Born out of the desire for affordability without sacrificing quality and design, the Analuisa Corrigan x Wooj collaboration was in development for over a year. Analuisa Corrigan, a ceramic artist and designer, and Wooj, a 3D printing lighting design company, married their unique crafts and skillsets to create The Scoop Lamp. After time deliberating over Analuisa’s existing designs, it was decided that the Scoop Lamp would be most conducive to printing. This was a piece included in her 2022 installation at Stroll Garden Gallery in Los Angeles, where she designed and built a living room out of ceramic, including a chair, floor lamp, wall mounted pieces.</p>
        <p>Deciding to 3D print the Scoop Lamp would not only elevate the design, it would give an opportunity to increase interest and overall likability by making the piece accessible to a wider audience. By changing the material from ceramic to 3D printed recycled plastic filaments, it would significantly reduce weight and fragility, allowing for enhanced durability and function. Wooj is known for their unique lighting designs along with their sustainable and ethically labored production process. Each of Wooj’s designs are 3D printed out of recycled plastic and hand assembled to order from their own Brooklyn studio.Due to the nature of the technology, 3D printed objects have “seams”. We decided to highlight The Scoop Lamp’s seam by adding a playful twist, on what is typically a straight line, into a squiggle pattern. The squiggle runs from the top of the shade to the bottom of the base, adding a distinctive and fun detail to the modern design.</p>
        <p>The Scoop Lamp’s unique glow and defused, warm light was made with the intention of adding a dreamlike ambience to a space. It’s printed in thinner layers towards the top of the lamp, allowing for a lovely halo effect, perfect for a bedside table, office desk or nightlight. </p>
