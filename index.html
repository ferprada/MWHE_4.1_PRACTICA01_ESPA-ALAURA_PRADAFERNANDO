          <h2>the scoop lamp</h2>
          <p>Born out of the desire for affordability without sacrificing quality and design, the Analuisa Corrigan x Wooj 
            collaboration was in development for over a year. Analuisa Corrigan, a ceramic artist and designer, and Wooj, 
            a 3D printing lighting design company, married their unique crafts and skillsets to create The Scoop Lamp. 
            After time deliberating over Analuisaâ€™s existing designs, it was decided that the Scoop Lamp would be most 
            conducive to printing. This was a piece included in her 2022 installation at Stroll Garden Gallery in Los Angeles, 
            where she designed and built a living room out of ceramic, including a chair, floor lamp, wall mounted pieces.</p>

          <p>House & Garden is a two-artist exhibition of all new works by Lily Clark and 
            Analuisa Corrigan. Conceived as a singular installation, the show welcomes 
            viewers into a home of domestic items rendered in clay by Corrigan and a garden 
            of working ceramic fountains by Clark, complimented by live plant vignettes 
            created by Alice Lam of A.L. BASA. In recontextualizing the familiar, the artists 
            invite a moment of pause to reengage our senses and reconsider our relationship to 
            often overlooked elements of the everyday, both domestic and elemental.</p>
